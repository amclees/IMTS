# Intelligent Minds Testing System

Intelligent Minds Testing System (IMTS) is a system designed to allow psychotherapists to exchange information with their patients through customized tests. The code contained within this repository represents a basic proof-of-concept using a MEAN stack with a single test.

This code was designed during the 2017 Inventathon held in March at UCLA's California Nanosystems Institute (CNSI).
